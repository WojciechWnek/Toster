# What is it supposed to be:
# This script acts as a simple json based repl.
# Input code needs to be inside "code" field.
# Output code sets success and result field.
# Json data needs to be newline terminated.

# TODO: This needs complete rework, as currently it breaks
#       when fnction print is being runned. This program should
#       spawn antoher process and communiacte with it.
#       This would potentially allow this to use another repl.
